        "Back in spring 2010, Kim Jung-soo, Vice Chairwoman of Samyang Foods, was grabbing lunch at this restaurant that served crazy spicy chicken on a sizzling hot plate.",
        "At that moment, she noticed people literally sweating, fanning their mouths, stuck somewhere between this is amazing and why am I doing this to myself? Watching them, she started thinking they could bottle this kind of spiciness in instant ramen.",
        "After that, the team set out to discover the ideal spice level for Korean consumers. They worked with peppers from different countries, such as Cheongyang, habanero, Vietnamese, Tabasco, and Bhut Jolokia, testing different mixes to nail down the best sauce balance.
